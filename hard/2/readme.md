# Word shift

Given two words of equal length that are in a dictionary,
write a method to transform one word into another word by 
changing only one letter at a time.

The new word you get in each step must be in the dictionary.

##EXAMPLE

    Input: DAMP, LIKE
    Output: DAMP -> LAMP -> LIMP -> LIME -> LIKE
