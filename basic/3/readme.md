#Quick sort

Implement a quick sort function which select first element as pivot

Also, need to implement a partition function that sort element
to larger than pivot and smaller than pivot part.
The partition function need to control it to do recursion or not by passing flag:

example:

    // will recursive sort element
    partition([3, 2, 1], 0, 2, ture);

    // will not
    partition([3, 2, 1], 0, 2, false);

##Extra

Try to implement quicksort in iteration
